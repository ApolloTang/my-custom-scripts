Solved this this error:

  Script Editor:
    System Events got an error: Script Editor is not allowed to send keystrokes.

  Need to add some (or all) of the following 'Security & Privacy' setting:

    Goto:
      System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Accessibility
      System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Input Monitoring
    Add:
      /System/Applications/Utilities/Script Editor.app
      /System/Library/CoreServices/AppleScript Utility
      /System/Library/CoreServices/System Events.app
      /usr/local/bin/bash
      /Applications/Setapp/ForkLift.app


    I also added the the appified app itself to 'Security & Privacy', eg:
      /path/to/my-custom-scripts/script-for-apps/forklift/forklift--open-new-window/forklift-new-window.app
